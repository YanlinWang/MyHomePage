== About me
I joined Software Engineering School, Sun Yat-sen University as an assistant professor in July 2022. 
Before that, I worked at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yanlwang/ Microsoft Research Asia], Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence (DKI) group as a senior researcher. 
I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/ Dr. Dongmei Zhang] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/ Shi Han] in MSRA.  
I received my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University and PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong under the supervision of 
 [https://www.cs.hku.hk/~bruno Prof. Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira]. #目前课题组仍有少量研究生名额，欢迎有读研意向的同学与我们联系!(yanlin-wang@outlook.com)
